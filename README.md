# Agents as Proxies for Neurosymbolic Research (APNR)

## Project Overview
This research project explores using AI agents as proxies for understanding neurosymbolic architectures. The core idea is to leverage agent behaviors and Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning to bridge the gap between neural and symbolic approaches to artificial intelligence.

### Research Goals
- Use agent behaviors to understand emergent neural-symbolic interactions
- Extract explicit symbolic rules from CoT reasoning while maintaining neural pattern connections
- Develop a framework for studying neurosymbolic architectures through agent behavior
- Build tools for analyzing the relationship between action patterns and reasoning chains
